      <h2><b>What is a Computer system?</b></h2>
      <section class="lesson-box">
        <p>
        A <b>computer system</b> consists of hardware components that have been carefully chosen so that they work well together and software components or programs that run in the computer.
        <br><br>
        The main software component is itself an operating system (OS) that manages and provides services to other programs that can be run in the computer.
        <br><br>
        In its most basic form, a computer system is a programmable electronic device that can accept input; store data; and retrieve, process and output information.

        <h2>Evolution of computers systems</h2>
        <p>
        Computers are programmable electronic devices that can process data.
        <br>
        To comprehend what a computer system is, it's important to analyze the history and evolution of computer system development over the years.
        </p>
        <h3>Early models</h3>
        <p>
        The history of computer systems goes way back to Charles Babbage's differential machines. Despite never being completed, this machine is considered the first example of a computing system. 
        <br>
         It came before the early 20th-century mainframes and large computers. The Von Neumann machine and others of its kind were later used as the first massive, monolithic computers in the human world.
        </p>
        <h3>The personal computer</h3>
        <p>
        The microprocessor revolution of the 1970s and 1980s saw the introduction of personal computers, also known as desktop computers.
        <br>
        The first true home computer that came with a monitor display was released to the public in 1977. At the time, many large organizations used expensive and massive computers. The personal computer employed a computer box as its main piece of hardware, together with peripheral devices such as a mouse and keyboard and computer software that was downloaded into floppy disks.
        </p>
        <h3>Operating system</h3>
        <p>
        The operating system was initially created to support a complete computer system in a box and to provide users with a common interface for using the software that operated on that hardware. 
        <br>
        Additionally, the actual software components to execute on a specific operating system, such as files, apps and executables, were also introduced. The first IBM PC, officially known as the IBM Model 5150, ran Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system and had an Intel 8088 processor running at 4.77 MHz.
        </p>
        <h3>Laptops</h3>
        <p>
        The laptops emerged as hardware became smaller and more portable over time. 
        <br>
        The Portal, the first authorized portable microcomputer, debuted in 1980. It was built using an 8-bit, 2 MHz Intel 8085 processor and was equipped with a 64K byte random access memory (RAM).
        </p>
        <h3>The Cloud</h3>
        <p>
        The introduction of the modern cloud in the early 2000s revolutionized software distribution and data storage. 
        <br>
        The out-of-the-box software strategy was rendered obsolete in the enterprise IT sector as software was provided digitally through the internet in place of physical media, such as floppy disks and compact disks.
        </p>
      <h3>Virtualization</h3>
        <p>
        The concept of hardware and software configurations has recently undergone a radical change thanks to virtualization.
        <br>
        Instead of using physical hardware, the majority of current computing systems use virtualized computer systems. Through the use of virtualization, a single computer's hardware resources can be split up into several virtual machines.
        </p>

        <h2>Components of a computer system</h2>
        <p>
          The components of a computer system are typically divided into hardware and software parts, which are both essential in making a computer system functional.
        </p>
        <h3>Hardware components</h3>
        <p>
          The hardware components include the computer itself; the physical parts inside the computer, such as a circuit board and storage devices; and any peripherals attached to the computer.
        <br>
          These components can be either classified as input devices, such as a mouse or keyboard, or output devices, such as a monitor or a printer. While output devices reflect or display user data, input devices are designed to accept user data.
        <br><br>
          <img src="images/computer system.jpg" >
        <br><br>
            The following are common hardware components of a computer system:
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>Keyboard</li>
            <Li>Monitor</Li>
            <li>Mouse</li>
            <li>Printer</li>
            <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</li>
            <li>Motherboard</li>
            <li>Computer case</li>
            <li>Graphics card</li>
            <li>Power supply unit</li>
            <li>RAM</li>
            <li>Hard disk drive</li>
            <li>Solid state drive</li>
            <li>DVD-ROM</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>Software components</h3>
          <p>
            Software components are the set of instructions that are stored and run on the computer hardware. The software controls how a computer system works. It can be grouped into the following two categories:
          <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>System software.</b>Programs that are needed for the computer to function, including the OS, utilities software, programming language translators and library routines. </li>
            <li><b>Application Software.</b>Programs that let a user perform particular tasks, including word processing, database management, spreadsheet calculations, web browsing, gaming, programming and graphic design. 
                   Additionally, it may also include specific programs such as accounts, payroll and air traffic control.</li>

            In 1822, English mathematician Charles Babbage (1792-1871)
            unveiled the first phase of his envisioned ―Difference Engine‖ which
            also used ten-position gears to represent decimal digits.
          </p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>It was capable of performing more complex calculations than the basic arithmetic of an adding machine

              reasons, Babbage abandoned the project.</li>

        <p>
          There are two main difficulties here, illustrating two key concepts in
          computing. First, these devices were ―mechanical‖ – i.e., they were
          devices that required physically moving and interconnected parts.
          Such a device is almost certain to be slower, more prone to failure, and
          more difficult to manufacture than a device that has no moving parts.
          <br>
          In contrast, ―electronic‖ devices such as vacuum tubes of the sort used in early radios have, by definition,
          no moving parts.
