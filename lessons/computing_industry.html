  <h2>What is Computer Science?</h2>
  <section class="lesson-box">
    <p>
      <b>This work of computer scietists falls into three categories:</b>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>designing and building software</li>
      <li>developing effective ways to solve computing problems, such as storing information in databases, sending data oer networks or providing new approaches to security problems.</li>
      <li>devising new and better ways of using computers and addressing particular challenges in areas such as robotics, computer vision, or digital forensics</li>
    </ul>

    <p> 
    Key findings from recent PSA surveys, including the 2021 Survey on
    Information and Communications Technology (SICT), highlight these
    trends:
    <ul type="disc" >
    <li><b>Growth In ICT utilization</b>
    <br>
    The Philippine computing industry shows strong growth in ICT use, with over half of employees using computers and internet, especially in ICT-enabled services (83.5% computer use) in 2021, though challenges like cost and infrastructure gaps persist, driving government and World Bank efforts to expand digital access
    and skills for greater inclusion and economic transformation, particularly for MSMEs and underserved areas. </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Expansion of Mobile Transactions</b>
    <br>
    The number of firms increased significantly between 2017 and 2019.
    utilizing mobile phone purchases, increasing by 133.1%. This illustrates the
    growing dependence of company operations on mobile technology. </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>E-commerence and digital Engagement</b>
      <br>
    E-commerce usage has been increasing as more companies participate in
    with transactions conducted online. Additionally, social media presence has increased.
    with about half of businesses in a variety of sectors currently keeping up social media profiles
